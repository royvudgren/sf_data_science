### Case description
A programm which can find out the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts

**Terms of competition**
- A computer guesses integer in range of 1 to 100. This number must be guessed. By "guessed" it is meant to write a programm which can pick a guessed number from a stated range;
- An algorithm must consider if the estimated number is greater or less than the guessed one.

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions.

**Field of practice**
- The practice in quality python code writing;
- The practice in IDE work;
- The practice in GitHub work.
